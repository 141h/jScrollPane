			<h1>jScrollPane - cross browser styleable scrollbars with jQuery and CSS</h1>
			<p>
				This is the home of my jScrollPane plugin which provides the ability to convert a browsers default
				scrollbars (as seen on elements with overflow: auto or scroll) into pretty scrollbars which can be
				easily skinned using CSS.
			</p>
			<p>
				The content of this page is still being written, for now I'm just using it to organise the links to the
				various demo/ test pages which I'm writing as I rewrite jScrollPane.
			</p>

			<h2 id="examples">Simple examples/ tests</h2>
			<p>
				These examples show very basic functionality and exist so that I can test that any changes to
				jScrollPane work cross browser and don't cause any new problems.

			<h2 id="support">Support</h2>
			<p>
				Before trying to get support please check if your problem is a <a href="known_issues.html">known
				issue</a> or if it is mentioned in the <a href="faqs.html">FAQs</a>. If your issue is a new one and
				you can't find any information about it then you can try one of the following two options:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Using the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> site. This is probably the
						place you are most likely to get a quick answer as many Javascript experts spend time on
						the site. It also provides niceties like pretty formatting of posted sourcecode.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you ask a question on the site make sure you add the tags "jquery" and "jscrollpane" as
						I will be monitoring these tags to try to provide support.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Through the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jscrollpane/">jScrollPane google group
						</a> - sign up and then you can start a discussion (either by email or through the web
						interface).
					</p>
					<p>
						Please remember to use the search field at the top of the group's homepage to search the
						archive to find out if your question has been answered before.
